    <h3>Lorde - Mood Ring</h3>
    <p> I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside <br>
        Can't seem to <b>fix my mood</b> <br>
        Today it's as dark as my roots <br>
        If I, if I ever let them grow out (ah-ah) <br>
        <ins>Now all of my oceans have riptides</ins> <br>
        Can't seem to find what's wrong <br>
        The whole world is letting me down <br>
        <del>Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? </del> <br> </p>

        <p>Ladies, begin your sun salutations <br>
        <em>Transcendental in your meditations (love and light)</em> <br>
        You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals<br>
        We can get high, but only if the wind blows <del>(blows just right)</del><br></p>

        <p>I can't feel a thing<br>
        I keep looking at my <small>mood ring</small><br>
        Tell me how I'm feeling<br>
        Floating away, floating away</p><br>
